# Number Guessing Game

The user is presented with a prompt to guess a number from 1 to 10.
The prompt should include the following message: "I have a secret number in my mind (1 - 10). You have 3 chances to guess it."
A Textbox should be provided that only accepts numeric characters for the user's input.
If the user enters the correct guess, the app should navigate to a new screen (Correct Guess Page) displaying the correct number and a congratulatory message: "Congratulations! You've guessed it correctly."
A button should be available to restart the game.
If the user enters a wrong number, the app should navigate to another screen (Wrong Guess Page) and display the message: "Sorry! Wrong guess. Please try again."
A button should be available to go back to the home screen.
If the user guesses the number incorrectly three times, the app should navigate to a third screen (Game Over Page) and display the message: "Game Over."
There should be a button to start the game again.
